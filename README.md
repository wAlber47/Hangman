Final Project for CSI-160

This is a python version of the classic game Hangman.
The rules are the same as the normal game.

#### Features Currently Implemented:
* Various Difficulties
    * Changes the lists of words to pull from, (various lengths and complexity).
* Two Player Versus Mode
    * Allows one player to pick the word, while another guesses
    
#### Possible Additions:
* Ability to implement a custom list of words
* Command-line "GUI"
    * Basic figures created with '/', '\', '|' and 'O' 
* Somehow to check inputted words from users in versus mode
    * Currently allows for random characters to be inputted, not English words.
